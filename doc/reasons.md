Second is a sad fact, that (I think) we're stucked in 70'ties if it concerns cpu architecture.

Neither is it Harvard or Neuman or different modifications - the base concepts are still the same.

We still use alu, registers, centralised synchronic "busses" and clock based processing in sequence (with a bunch of additional optmisation techniques like caches or out of order processing)

Is it CISC or RISC - all this is just deviations from one common aproach.

My thought was - it is miserable. Is it all that can be achived ?

Or we're just in hands of few monopolistic companies ? 

Some hope is new RISC-V open source processor movement.

It is very nice fresh design - but it is still just opensourcing classical aproach.

Can't it be that there are other aproaches possible ?

IE distributed one with easy scalable subcomponents calculating one simple thing ?

Or: clockless one - working with smooth speed not in a rythm of "Paradeschritt" ?

Or: neural network like ?

Or: hierarchical one organized like LISP - to take over subsequent layers of compilation ? 

Or: non-binary one - based on chips with more states/voltage than just 2 ?

Or ... ? Who knows what's yet in there ?

Why we are sitting still in the cave ? Just because of tons of code and systems writen ?

Could we recompile them to new hardware ?

RISC-V opened possibility of producing custom cpus using classicach architecture,
I think it is not enough. There is a need to give people easy start for designing and simulating completely new aproaches.

makaronLab is (or rather I woud say may be) a tool to achieve this.
