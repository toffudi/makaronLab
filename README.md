## There were few reasons for this project.

First is wonderfull series of videos from Ben Eater on building 8bit cumputer from scratch.

https://eater.net/8bit

It was an inspiration for me to try and do the same using some simulation.

Trying to simulate Ben's series I haven't found anything that would be really usable.

Closest was wonderful simulator "Spaghetti" by  Artur Wyszy≈Ñski (aljen) 

https://github.com/aljen/spaghetti

I had to tune it a little bit, add some additional features and to prepare a library of specialised components to simulate CPU.

## Getting started

Currently makaronLab is Linux based - I think that in the era of docker this is no longer any problem.

If You're stucked with Windows (like I was for many years ...) it really a good occasion to leave the cave ... 

You can simply run it using docker image containing Linux Mint Desktop and makaronLab preinstalled:

If You prefer to go deeper - compile it Yourself - it is as simple as:

mkdir -p /src && cd /src && git clone http://github.com/virtimus/makaronLab && cd makaronLab/install && ./bootstrap-dev.sh

You can also use standarised development environment available as Docker container:
