SidePanel part is a port to Python of nice lib from https://github.com/inobelar/QSidePanel

The code was somehow redundant - so I've optimised it a little bit 

IE instead of few classes PanelLeftSide/TopSide etc there is only one class
- SidePanel with constructor keyword property "side"

Code currently dependant of my q3 lib but should be simple to decouple
