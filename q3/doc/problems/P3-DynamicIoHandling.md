Probably problems with dynamic io - to be fixed
- on setting driveSignal (replacing) need going through all connected nodes and change driveSignal correspondingly ...
- corrected when using video3.py sample - seems to work now but dynamic handler need some work through together with ioNodes handling (inputs/outputs/ionodes/ui etc)
